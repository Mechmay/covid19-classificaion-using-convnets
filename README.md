This project uses the extraordicary power of concolutional neural networks to create an algorithm that identifies Covid-19 using x-ray lung scans.
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness such as respiratory diseases or gastrointestinal diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been identified in humans previously. Once scientists determine exactly what coronavirus it is, they give it a name (as in the case of COVID-19, the virus causing it is SARS-CoV-2).

Coronaviruses got their name from the way that they look under a microscope. The virus consists of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. The word Corona means “crown” in Latin.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. It has been determined that MERS-CoV was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans and SARS-CoV from civet cats to humans.  The source of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is yet to be determined, but investigations are ongoing to identify the zoonotic source to the outbreak.

## Transmissions of covid19
Evidence is still emerging, but current information is indicating that human-to-human transmission is occurring. The routes of transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear at present, but evidence from other coronaviruses and respiratory diseases indicates that the disease may spread through large respiratory droplets and direct or indirect contact with infected secretions. Airborn transmission can occur in crowded places and indoor rooms with poor ventilated, especially infected persons spending a long time with others, like a shopping mall, restaurant, etc. And also airborn transmission occurs in medical care settings while conducting medical care procedures ( aerosol-generating procedures ).
